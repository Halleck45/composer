# How do I know if my dependencies are up-to-date ?

There are two ways to check if any updates are available for your project :

- directly in your terminal with the following command:

    php composer.phar update --dry-run

- using an external service, like [dependency.me](http://dependency.me) if your project is hosted on Github.
